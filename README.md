This project uses Python to download, analyze, and visualize stock data for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using various technical indicators. The visualizations include candlestick charts with moving averages, Bollinger Bands, VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), and highlighted date ranges. The final charts are styled using Plotly in dark mode.
